# v1.0.0 Update Details

> Yejingram’s first official release!

This v1.0.0 update includes the following new features and improvements.

## New Features

- Token limit control
- ComfyUI support
- ArtStyle management tools
- Image regenerate feature
- Continue generating conversation
- UI theme customization (Light mode / Dark mode / Custom themes)
- Sync server support
- Multi-language support (Korean, English, Japanese)
- View announcements
- Added support for Claude Sonnet 4.5

## Improvements

- Improved message editing UI
- Added click-to-enlarge for images
- Improved chat open action (on mobile, double-tap; on desktop, click to open the chat window)
- Improved AI settings page (to reduce clutter, generation parameter settings have been moved under Prompt Settings)
- Enhanced NovelAI image generation
  - Added parameter controls for image generation requests (when NAI model is selected, adjustable in the Image Settings tab)
  - Added negative prompt input for images (applies negative prompts defined in ArtStyle during generation)
  - Added character style recognition mode (recognizes and applies the style of the registered character profile image)
- Improved error page (you can view the error stack)
- Improved DB migration (when accessing a higher-version page from an older version, or loading data from an older version, migration runs automatically)
- Support for OpenAI Structured Output
- Improved character edit screen (fixed an issue where editing another character while the editor was open caused multiple windows to open at once)
- UI improvements for overly long preview messages and group chat participant list (sidebar recent chat preview and group chat participants are kept to a single line)
- Introduced AI JSON Fixer (fallback for cases where structured output from some models like Claude does not match the specified schema)

## Removed Features

- Temporarily removed settings related to the “first-message” feature. For technical reasons, unless the user keeps the web page open at all times, it’s not feasible to trigger a first message. Judging that practical demand is low, we’ve decided to put completion of the feature on hold for now. It may be reintroduced in the future.

## Yejingram Domain Migration and Developer Preview

> We bought a domain!
>
> We even got a .com!

Accordingly, the address has moved from https://yejingram.vercel.app/ to https://yejingram.com/. The original Vercel app address will continue to be available.

However, data you were using at the old address must be exported manually and then imported on yejingram.com.

Additionally, for those who want to try features under development before their official release, we’re opening a developer preview website at https://dev.yejingram.com/.

> Note: The developer preview website may change at any time without notice, and data loss may be unavoidable due to database schema changes and errors during development. The Yejingram development team assumes no responsibility for such loss.

## Details of Major Additions and Improvements

### Token Limit

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30523311-f218-4e05-80d7-23135199f9b4" />

You can limit the maximum input/output tokens. For each model, we count input tokens and, if the maximum is exceeded, reduce the number of messages included in the request.

### ComfyUI Support

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f5e6118-e23f-466e-b218-4f22fef21fb7" />

ComfyUI is supported. You can conveniently edit workflows via a JSON editor.

### ArtStyle Management Tools

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e20762d8-b070-4f66-8ed5-25ac900d747a" />

You can manage positive/negative prompts to be sent along with image generation requests.

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97bb0915-2349-4ea7-abed-d3e5fd8d31e5" />

You can also create multiple ArtStyles and choose among them.

### Image Regenerate

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9526461-2d08-42a0-8c79-ebbcebbf5d06" />

You can request to regenerate a generated image. On mobile, tap the image; on desktop, hover over the image to reveal the regenerate button.

### Continue Generating Conversation

<img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f72a9285-84f9-4120-9c52-7a7b87719d62" />

“Continue generation” has been added to the message action menu that appears when you tap the character’s last message (mobile) or hover over the last message (desktop).

> Yejingram is a 1:1 / 1:N chat platform, so only the character’s responses will be continued. It won’t auto-generate the user’s reply to advance the story.

### UI Theme Customization

Light mode, Dark mode, System setting, and Custom theme are available.

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/697b6bab-e916-4453-9480-4eed5d5f3275" />

We provide a lightweight Express-based sync server. You can download and run it locally; see the Help for details: [README – Sync Server (optional)](https://github.com/YEJIN-DEV/yejingram/blob/main/README.md#sync-server-optional).

### Multi-language Support

In addition to Korean, English and Japanese are supported. There may be translation errors. Please submit issues or suggestions on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/YEJIN-DEV/yejingram/issues).

### Improved Message Editing UI

<img width="1000" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebab1a33-08a3-4650-ada7-ed984d99cb74" />

The size of the input shown during message editing has been increased. This should improve usability.

### Click Image to Enlarge

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f636c213-5d51-4e47-be24-ce0f14e7350d" />

Click a generated or sent image to view it larger.

On mobile, double-tap; on desktop, click.

### NovelAI Parameter Controls

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b969e73a-34b3-4a68-958a-a555f04a7e28" />

We added the NovelAI image generation parameter controls that were missing in the beta release. This appears when the NAI model is selected in the Image Settings tab.

Also, turning on Style Recognition mode lets NAI recognize and apply the drawing style of the current character’s profile image.

### View Announcements

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f73ccd42-0941-4ccc-aed6-cc90efb634b8" />

You can check system announcements via the megaphone icon at the top of the sidebar.

Important release notes, patch notes, and system incident notices will be posted here!

## How to Resolve Migration Errors After Updating

Basic migrations should be handled, but settings may still get tangled. If you see the error screen below,
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b448d76f-40ce-4d2a-8f3b-db5dd9ad1bf0" />

Resetting API settings, prompt settings, user information, and other settings will not affect your chat history; only saved environment settings such as API keys, prompts, and parameters will be reset.

> Note: If you choose “Reset Saved Database,” your chat history will also be cleared!

If the error screen still appears after going through the four reset steps, please first back up your data using the Backup button, then check Error Details and let us know—we’ll help as best as we can.

## Closing

Since the beta release, it has taken about a month to make Yejingram more complete. We believe the essential features are now largely complete and improved.

Now that we’ve made an official release, we’ll be able to reflect new features and bug fixes on the live site more quickly!

We’re always sincerely grateful for your use and interest in Yejingram!
