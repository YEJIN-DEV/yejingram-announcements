## Detailed Feature Introductions

### Proactive Messaging Server

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7104770c-ed74-4d6d-bb3c-af83a5fe6c7f" />

At last, fully automated proactive messaging is here! Just like the previous sync/backup server, you need to download and set up the proactive messaging server yourself. It works in conjunction with the sync server.

You can receive multiple notifications like this, and

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44d8f275-a753-49a7-b88b-86694c1e9ff7" />

if you leave in the middle of a conversation,

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e20fd6bf-d403-4706-a840-0fa8a0127802" />

you'll see the character naturally follow up after a short while.

Depending on the AI's "intelligence level", you might get something like this:

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/939865be-0a90-47eb-93ec-40d8478dac08" />

...a hilariously silly message (and image) at 4 AM, so make sure to configure your time zone settings properly!

> Note: You must enable "Allow Proactive Messages" in the chat room where you want to receive them.

### Realm (Beta) Service

[Go to Yejin Realm](https://realm.yejingram.com/)

To promote character sharing and creation, Yejingram is launching the Realm service!

Character page section

We look forward to bot creators and Yejingram users making the most of Realm!

(Sneaking in a quick mention — Yejingram's first official character, `Lee Yejin`, is now registered on Realm. Show her some love!)

Markdown syntax is supported in character descriptions for rich formatting.

### Backup Optimization

A patch-based approach has been introduced for the backup/sync server, significantly optimizing both server and client.

Sync operations that previously took about 5 seconds

have been reduced to under 0.1 seconds thanks to the patch-based optimization.

### Binary File Storage / Binary Caching

We discovered that image files previously stored as DataURLs caused errors in Chromium-based browsers when exceeding a certain size (~100 MB).

Files are now stored in binary format, and binary caching has been introduced to load images roughly 10× faster.

> Note: Immediately after the update, previously sent/received images may not display correctly. A page refresh will resolve this.

### Headless Yejingram

A UI-less, server-oriented version of Yejingram has been created to support the proactive messaging server. We look forward to even more diverse ways of using Yejingram!

### New Announcement Notifications

Indicators have been added so you never miss an announcement.
